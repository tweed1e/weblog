<p>Was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Rose">Jalen Rose</a> really the first Jalen? He claims his mother was the first to make up the name, a combo of his fatherâ€™s (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker_(basketball,_born_1944)">NBA player Jimmie Walker</a>) and uncleâ€™s (Leonard) names. And now we see them everywhere: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts">Jalen Hurts</a> (the Alabama QB that was benched in the national title game a few weeks ago) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Ramsey">Jalen Ramsey</a> (Jags cornerback). Was he really? On the other hand, Shaq is an equally distinct name, what happened after he got famous?</p>
<p>This project is almost one line. Get a dataset of babyname counts (via <a href="https://github.com/hadley/babynames">Hadleyâ€™s <code>babynames</code></a>), filter for Jalen and Shaq(uille), and plot them over time. But first weâ€™ll see if there were any Jalens before he started at Michigan in 1991:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(babynames)
babynames %&gt;% 
  filter(name == &quot;Jalen&quot;) %&gt;% 
  group_by(name, year) %&gt;% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))
## # A tibble: 33 x 3
## # Groups:   name [?]
##    name   year     n
##    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
##  1 Jalen  1976     5
##  2 Jalen  1977     5
##  3 Jalen  1981     5
##  4 Jalen  1986     5
##  5 Jalen  1988     5
##  6 Jalen  1990     5
##  7 Jalen  1991    15
##  8 Jalen  1992   642
##  9 Jalen  1993  1468
## 10 Jalen  1994  1770
## # â€¦ with 23 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Jalen was born in 1973 but it doesnâ€™t show up until 1976. Iâ€™m guessing the <code>babynames</code> dataset is censored at 5 to preserve confidentiality or something. So he mightâ€™ve been the first! But unless his mother was promoting the name when he was 3, others invented â€˜Jalenâ€™ simultaneously.</p>
<p>But you can definitely see â€˜Jalenâ€™ uptick when he hit the national stage. What does the trend look like? How does it compare to a similarly famous and unique name?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>babynames %&gt;% 
  filter(name %in% c(&quot;Jalen&quot;, &quot;Shaquille&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(name, year) %&gt;% summarize(n = sum(n)) %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, group = name, colour = name)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_line() +
    labs(title = &quot;Jalen v Shaq as baby names&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Number of babies&quot;) + 
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Name&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>Daaaaaaaang Jalen ðŸ’¯. #gtpwtw since 1991. Around 1992-3 Shaq looks just as popular, then ppl realize itâ€™s crazy to call your baby Shaquille, heâ€™s too famous! E.g., the only person who can name a baby Lebron is Lebron. (Err, wait! There were 6 Lebrons born in 1925?!)</p>
<p>But Jalen sticks around and hits a maximum of 3680 per year in 2000. Heâ€™s slid off since then, but still, very impressive Jalen.</p>
