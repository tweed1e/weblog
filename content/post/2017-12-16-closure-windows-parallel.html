<h2>Your situation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>you have a big data frame</li>
<li>you want to apply a (pretty complex) function to each row</li>
<li>you are on a Windows server</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you know baby names are much cooler when they have no vowels and no uppercase letters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># a dataset of babynames
library(babynames)

# a function that drops vowels from names
drop_vowels &lt;- function(text) {
  gsub(&quot;[aeiou]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, text) 
}
mutate_names &lt;- function(tbl) {
  # names are cooler with no vowels and no capital letters.
  dplyr::mutate(tbl, name := drop_vowels(tolower(name)))
}

mutate_names(babynames[1:10, ])

<p>But <code>babynames</code> has 1,858,689 rows! It may take a long time to process everything. So your first idea is to start parallel processes, split the data frame, <code>parLapply</code> the function to each table in the split list, then <code>bind_rows</code> them back together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(parallel)
cl &lt;- makeCluster(detectCores())
bind_rows(parLapply(cl, split(babynames, babynames$year), mutate_names))
stopCluster(cl)
## Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) : 
##    2 nodes produced errors; first error: 
##    Evaluation error: could not find function &quot;drop_vowels&quot;. </code></pre>
<p>On Mac, you can choose between <code>parLapply</code> and <code>mclapply</code>, but on Windows you only have <code>parLapply</code>. <code>parLapply</code> creates processes that don’t have access to the global environment (see this Stack Overflow Q for technical details on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17196261/understanding-the-differences-between-mclapply-and-parlapply-in-r">parallel processing on Windows vs Mac</a>), so <code>add_bang</code> isn’t passed to the clusters that are trying to run <code>mutate_names</code>. They don’t know anything other than what you give them (they also don’t know where to find <code>mutate</code> unless you use <code>dplyr::mutate</code> or <code>library(dplyr)</code> inside the function). (Even then, if your libraries aren’t on the search path, you can’t find them no matter what, but I haven’t solved that problem yet.)</p>
<p>One option is to use <code>parallelsugar</code> (via <a href="https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar">nathanvan</a>), which approximates the <code>mclapply</code> function on Mac that has access to the global environment. <code>parallelsugar</code> works by using <code>parallel::clusterExport</code> to export objects to the child processes. However, if your data frame is large (or if you have other large things in the global environment, or lots of unrelated packages), it can take forever to set up the clusters.</p>
<p>If you like, you can use the same logic to pick and choose a few things to export until it starts to work. Here we could use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># start the cluster here
clusterExport(cl, &quot;drop_vowels&quot;)
# call parLapply
# stop cluster</code></pre>
<p>But you don’t want to keep track of all the dependencies every time you write a new function, and you <em>can’t</em> do it when you write a wrapper to <code>parLapply</code> that takes a function like <code>mutate_names</code> as an input (because the wrapper function won’t know what the argument function depends on).</p>
</div>
<div id="closure-to-the-rescue" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html#closures">Closure</a> to the rescue!</h2>
<p>Instead, you can use a closure to encapsulate <code>drop_vowels</code> function inside the <code>mutate_names</code> function, so that <code>mutate_names</code> <em>always</em> has access to that function without you passing it to every new child.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># this returns a function! 
mutate_names_ &lt;- function() { 
  # &quot;save&quot; the `drop_vowels` from the global environment 
  # into this function&#39;s environment,
  # which then gets passed to each child process
  drop_vowels &lt;- drop_vowels
  function(tbl) {
    # names are cooler with no vowels and no capital letters.
    dplyr::mutate(tbl, name = drop_vowels(tolower(name)))
  }
}

# then **call** the mutate_names_() function to return the
# function with an environment that contains the functions
# you need, add_bang, drop_vowels
mutate_names &lt;- mutate_names_()

# then start the cluster
cl &lt;- makeCluster(detectCores())
bind_rows(parLapply(cl, split(babynames, babynames$year), mutate_names))
stopCluster(cl)</code></pre>
<p>Done! Now your baby names are cooler in half the time!</p>
</div>
<div id="more-complex-use-case" class="section level2">
<h2>More complex use case</h2>
<p>The real payoff comes when you write a function to perform the clustering steps together:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>parLapply_tbl &lt;- function(.x, .f) {
  # randomly split the tbl into parts
  n_cl &lt;- detectCores()
  .x &lt;- split(.x, sample.int(n_cl, nrow(.x), replace = TRUE)) 
  
  # then cluster apply things on that list of split tbls
  cl &lt;- makeCluster(n_cl)
  tryCatch({
    .x &lt;- bind_rows(parLapply(cl, .x, .f))
  }, finally = {
    stopCluster(cl)   
  })
  .x
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you can’t dynamically <code>clusterExport</code> things until you get it right without going with the full <code>parallelsugar</code> approach (passing everything in <code>globalenv</code>, big and small). But the <code>closure</code> passes exactly what you need!</p>
<p>(N.B. the <code>tryCatch</code> keeps you from hanging child processes without any way to kill them.)</p>
</div>
